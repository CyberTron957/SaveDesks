Icon Files Needed:

To complete the extension, you'll need to create these icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can use the included icon.svg file as a reference to create these PNG files.
Convert the SVG to the required PNG sizes using any image editor or online SVG to PNG converter.

Place all three PNG files in this directory.

Alternatively, you can create your own custom icons following these specifications.
